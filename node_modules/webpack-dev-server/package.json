This should be used for **development only**.\n\nIt uses [webpack-dev-middleware][middleware-url] under the hood, which provides\nfast in-memory access to the webpack assets.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n  - [With the CLI](#with-the-cli)\n  - [With NPM Scripts](#with-npm-scripts)\n  - [The Result](#the-result)\n- [Browser Support](#browser-support)\n- [Support](#support)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Attribution](#attribution)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst things first, install the module:\n\n```console\nnpm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev\n```\n\n_Note: While you can install and run webpack-dev-server globally, we recommend\ninstalling it locally. webpack-dev-server will always use a local installation\nover a global one._\n\n## Usage\n\nThere are two main, recommended methods of using the module:\n\n### With the CLI\n\nThe easiest way to use it is with the CLI. In the directory where your\n`webpack.config.js` is, run:\n\n```console\nnode_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server\n```\n\n_**Note**: Many CLI options are available with `webpack-dev-server`. Explore this [link](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)._\n\n### With NPM Scripts\n\nNPM package.json scripts are a convenient and useful means to run locally installed\nbinaries without having to be concerned about their full paths. Simply define a\nscript as such:\n\n```json\n\"scripts\": {\n  \"start:dev\": \"webpack-dev-server\"\n}\n```\n\nAnd run the following in your terminal/console:\n\n```console\nnpm run start:dev\n```\n\nNPM will automagically reference the binary in `node_modules` for you, and\nexecute the file or command.\n\n### The Result\n\nEither method will start a server instance and begin listening for connections\nfrom `localhost` on port `8080`.\n\nwebpack-dev-server is configured by default to support live-reload of files as\nyou edit your assets while the server is running.\n\nSee [**the documentation**][docs-url] for more use cases and options.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nWhile `webpack-dev-server` transpiles the client (browser) scripts to an ES5\nstate, the project only officially supports the _last two versions of major\nbrowsers_. We simply don't have the resources to support every whacky\nbrowser out there.\n\nIf you find a bug with an obscure / old browser, we would actively welcome a\nPull Request to resolve the bug.\n\n## Support\n\nWe do our best to keep Issues in the repository focused on bugs, features, and\nneeded modifications to the code for the module. Because of that, we ask users\nwith general support, \"how-to\", or \"why isn't this working\" questions to try one\nof the other support channels that are available.\n\nYour first-stop-shop for support for webpack-dev-server should by the excellent\n[documentation][docs-url] for the module. If you see an opportunity for improvement\nof those docs, please head over to the [webpack.js.org repo][wjo-url] and open a\npull request.\n\nFrom there, we encourage users to visit the [webpack Gitter chat][chat-url] and\ntalk to the fine folks there. If your quest for answers comes up dry in chat,\nhead over to [StackOverflow][stack-url] and do a quick search or open a new\nquestion. Remember; It's always much easier to answer questions that include your\n`webpack.config.js` and relevant files!\n\nIf you're twitter-savvy you can tweet [#webpack][hash-url] with your question\nand someone should be able to reach out and lend a hand.\n\nIf you have discovered a :bug:, have a feature suggestion, or would like to see\na modification, please feel free to create an issue on Github. _Note: The issue\ntemplate isn't optional, so please be sure not to remove it, and please fill it\nout completely._\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome your contributions!
